#
#  Do you have data in S3? Do you want to access this data within Snowflake from dbt?
#  Well you can, with the dbt-external-tables package!
#
#  GUIDE
#
#  (1) Create a Snowflake external stage, e.g.,:
#
#        create or replace stage boerse url='s3://deutsche-boerse-eurex-pds/' file_format = (type=csv)
# 
#  (2) Add the dbt-external-tables package in packages.yml
# 
#  (3) Execute `dbt run-operation stage_external_sources` to create the external tables,
#      and to refresh them later. (Add this to your dbt Cloud Job.)
#
#  (4) Access the source data from dbt, e.g.,
#
#        select * from {{ source('deutsche_boerse', 'trading_data') }}
# 
#  OTHER EXTERNAL TABLES
#
#  This package works with Snowpipes, GCS buckets, Redshift Spectrum tables, and more!
